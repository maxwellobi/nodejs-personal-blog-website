        p.text-center Welcome to my personal blog, a place I vent, rant and spit my opinions â€“ my opinions!!
        p I am an entrepreneur and I write code. I have a BSc in Computer Science, worked with Unified Payments Systems Limited and The Platform Technologies, founded Greex Technologies, Paydial, and currently the Co-founder/CTO at Amplify Payments.
        p I love chess, strategy, driving (hope to be a race car driver in next life ðŸ˜Š ), books and video games â€“ (favs: God of war, Call of Duty, Battle Field etc).
        p I never fit in, always looking to stand out, explore and try new things. More of having a flare for risks. I am an introvert with a big heart â€“ so please say hi when next we meet. 
        p My goal is to see cutting edge innovation and technology emerge from Africa and prevail worldwide â€“ and be a part of it.
